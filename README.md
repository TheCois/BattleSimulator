# BattleSimulator
Go experiment recreating a BattleSimulator
This is used to solidify my learning of Go features

## Next features
(in no particular priority order)
- Improve path search algorithms (directional restrictions, greedy approach, caching of destinations)
- Change the "timing" of move actions to match that of attack actions (i.e. number of rounds between moves; the idea being to make time "extensible" by increasing those rates)
- Add obstacles to the maps (i.e, walls, rivers, trees)
- Add elevation to the maps 
- Add simple visualization features (using Unity)
- Add texture to the maps (colour, reflectivity)
- Add directional energy weapons (e.g, railgun)
- Define grammar and storage features for a battlefield so as to enable loading from disk
- Add different tessellations for the terrain (triangles, squares)
- Replace "in-class" logging with event firing and centralised logging
- Add round statistics (moves, attacks, hits, deaths) per team and kind
- Define an area generator for "surrounding band"
- Define an area generator for ring
- Define heuristic for ranged units that can back away from enemy while engaging
